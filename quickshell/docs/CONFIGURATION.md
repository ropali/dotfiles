# Bar configuration

All bar geometry is configured in `config/Settings.qml`. Quickshell watches the
config and reloads QML changes, but compositor layout changes (width, height,
exclusive zone) can require a full restart to take effect cleanly:

```bash
pkill -x qs
qs -p $HOME/dotfiles/quickshell --daemonize
```

After editing any geometry value, restart the shell once to be sure Hyprland
recalculates the reserved area.

## Width

```qml
property int barWidthPercent: 80
property int edgeGap: 24
```

- `barWidthPercent` is the percentage of the monitor width used by the bar.
  The bar stays centered, so the remaining percentage is split equally between
  the two sides.
- `edgeGap` is the minimum gap between the bar and the left/right screen edge.
  It clamps the computed width so the bar cannot touch the screen edge.

Examples:

| Goal | Setting |
|---|---|
| Bar spans 80%, 10% free on each side | `barWidthPercent: 80` |
| Bar spans 100%, but keeps a 24px edge gap | `barWidthPercent: 100` (the `edgeGap` clamp applies) |
| Bar spans 50% | `barWidthPercent: 50` |

## Gap between the bar and tiled windows

```qml
property int barWindowGap: 4
```

`barWindowGap` is the visible gap between the bottom of the bar and the top of a
tiled window (or the top of the bar and the bottom of a window when the bar is at
the bottom). Set it to `0` for windows to touch the bar.

Hyprland normally adds its own `general:gaps_out` between the reserved bar space
and window edges. The shell reads `general:gaps_out` from Hyprland and subtracts
it from the reserved zone, so `barWindowGap` is the real visible gap and stays
correct when `gaps_out` changes. The value is re-read when Hyprland reloads its
configuration.

Do not confuse this with `screenMargin`, which is the gap between the bar and the
screen edge.

## Other bar options

```qml
property int barHeight: 34       // bar height in logical pixels
property int screenMargin: 4     // gap from the bar to the screen edge
property string barPosition: "top"  // "top" or "bottom"
```

## Complete example

```qml
// config/Settings.qml
property int barHeight: 34
property int barWidthPercent: 80
property int edgeGap: 24
property int screenMargin: 4
property string barPosition: "top"
property int barWindowGap: 4
```

With a 2560px-wide monitor this produces a 2048px bar centered at x=256, leaving
256px (10%) free on each side, and a 4px visible gap between the bar and tiled
windows.
